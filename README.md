LEARNING OUTCOME
In this project, we faced a lot of challenges like collaborating with all team members at the same time. But yes!, We learned a lot about teamwork and also how to communicate well in a team. We also learned how to apply soft skills in a team to cooperate in work. We also applied some concepts that we didn't know before. All this happened because of our team's spirit to learn and apply new things. And at last, we all achieved what we wanted in our website
